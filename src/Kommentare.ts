Looovely suggestions:

Data
  - QR code: he recognizes also small-axis qr codes and bar-codes, great.
    for small-axis qr codes, software does not go back to previous screen but keeps adding to data
 

Low priority issues:
    - svg does not render text
    - font same size as in table; no boxes around text (does the view create boxes?)
